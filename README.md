#### Icons

Currently using the [Material Design Icons](http://google.github.io/material-design-icons) from Google with the [Material Design Iconic Font](http://zavoloklom.github.io/material-design-iconic-font/examples.html) project. Not entirely happy with this solution but it's adequate for development right now and the page size is acceptable.

When using icons, please use the `{% icon "zmdi zmdi-label-heart zmd-fw %}` (example) tag so that `aria-hidden` and `role` properties are added.
